Before you come into DMV to take your written test, practice taking one (or all) of these sample tests.

Note: To allow you sufficient time for testing DMV will not be administering written or audio exams after 4:30 p.m.

Those of you with high speed Internet access are also encouraged to try our Driving Knowledge Tutorial. 

When you are ready to take the actual test, keep these suggestions in mind:

Review the California Driver Handbook. It contains a lot of information and it may take you a few days to get through it.
Read the test questions carefully. Don't read anything extra into the question. There will be one correct answer and the other two answer choices will be either obviously wrong or not appropriate for the question asked.
Remember, all the test questions are taken from the handbook. If you miss a question, the field office employee can tell you on which page to find the correct answer.
Don't be nervous. DMV wants you to pass your test. Good Luck!
CAUTION: 
Your browser must be JavaScript enabled to complete the sample driver tests. Only JavaScript enabled browsers will check your answer and provide an immediate pop-up response indicating if your answer was correct or not.

Browsers that do not support JavaScript may seem to indicate the wrong answer as the correct answer. An answer sheet is provided for those browsers which do not support JavaScript. New questions will be added periodically.
